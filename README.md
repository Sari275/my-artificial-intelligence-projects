# my-artificial-intelligence-projects
Repository for all my Artificial Intelligence (COEN 266) projects under Prof. Max Kreminski. 
- Training and Inference of the developed models was done using Google Collab's Backend GPUs and TPUs.
- Project 1  *Construct a series of agent functions that implement different uninformed search algorithms and report their performance on different example problems.
- Project 2  *Construct and evaluate agent functions for two heuristic-informed search algorithms.
- Project 3  *Construct and analyze a value iteration procedure to solve several example Markov decision processes (MDPs).
- Project 4  *Implement two different reinforcement learning algorithms and apply them to solve a set of MDPs without relying on an explicitly given T(s, a, s') or R(s, a, s') function, using data learned from a series of training episodes in which the agent tries out different actions to learn what they do.
